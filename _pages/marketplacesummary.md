<h2> If you had to improve Olist marketplace, what would you do?</h2>
  
This project answers the following business questions:
- How long is the seller acquisition journey?
- What is the average time it takes to a new merchant (a.k.a seller) to sell for the first time after being acquired?
- Are there any products/business segments doing particularly wellâ€¦ or particularly badly? 
- Are Olist new acquired and overall sellers finding what they are looking for (selling more/revenue increase)? What are the characteristics of the top sellers? Are they happy?
- What channels are bringing in more top selling sellers?

The anonymised datasets used in this case study were generously provided by Olist. Consist of a sample of their real data, with information on +100k orders from 2016 to 2018 as well as +8k Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) from potential sellers that requested contact between Jun. 2017 and Jun 2018. You can find (and play with!) these datasets [here](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/marketing-funnel-olist/home).
